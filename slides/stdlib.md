One of Go's strenghts is the feature-rich standard library allowing many things out of the box.

* file archives: tar, zip

* compression algorithms: bzip2, deflate, gzip, lzw, zlib

* crypto algorithms: AES, DES, DSA, ECDSA, HMAC, MD5, RC4, RSA, SHA{1,256,512}, TLS, X.509

* encodings: ASN.1 (DER), base{32,64}, CSV, JSON, XML, ...

* image manipulation: GIF, JPEG, PNG

* HTTP: client, server (including HTTPS support), CGI, FastCGI, URL parser

* Other net-related things: email parser, SMTP client, JSON-RPC

* ...and many more. Full list available here: [http://golang.org/pkg/](http://golang.org/pkg/)
