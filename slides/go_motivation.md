Title: What is Go? Why Go?

* People at Google saw need for a new systems language.

* Systems programming has become too didfficult and too frustrating.

* Aim to be easy: combine ease of programming of an interpreted dynamically typed language with efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language.

* Aim to be modern: support for networking and multi-core computing.

* Aim to be fast: fast builds, fast execution.
